        "It involves assembling prefabricated, insulated wall, floor, and ceiling panels on-site, allowing for rapid deployment and creating a precisely controlled, integrated storage environment.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to build a modular cold room?",
      answer:
        "Thanks to off-site manufacturing and plug-and-play assembly, most installations are fully commissioned within 1–4 weeks, significantly accelerating operational readiness.",
    },
    {
      question: "What materials are used for modular cold rooms?",
      answer:
        "We use high-quality Insulated Sandwich Panels (PUF/PIR), stainless steel or aluminum sheets, and vapor barriers, ensuring superior thermal insulation, hygiene, and durability.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can modular cold rooms be expanded or moved?",
      answer:
        "Yes, their modular nature provides exceptional flexibility. Panels can be easily dismantled, expanded, or relocated with minimal downtime, supporting scaling operations.",
    },
    {
      question: "What temperature range can a modular cold room hold?",
      answer:
        "These units reliably maintain temperatures from chilled (+15°C) down to deep-freeze (−40°C), suitable for all sensitive goods, including pharmaceuticals and seafood.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the energy efficiency and maintenance benefits?",
      answer:
        "Insulated modular structures minimize thermal loss, dramatically reducing power consumption and operating costs, supported by highly efficient compressors and smart controls.",
    },
    {
      question: "What standards and approvals are required for construction?",
      answer:
        "Compliance is mandatory. Construction adheres to crucial regulatory frameworks, including HACCP, ISO, GMP, and all local fire, structural, and electrical safety codes.",
