              <span className="font-bold">Landsking Infra pvt.ltd</span> A
              Pre-Engineered Building (PEB) is a steel structure based on a
              structural framework of primary framing (columns and rafters),
              secondary framing (purlins and girts), along with roof and wall
              sheeting, and other components. All parts are pre-fabricated in
              factories and assembled on-site, drastically reducing construction
              time compared to conventional methods.
