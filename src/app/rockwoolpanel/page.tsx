                Rockwool Panel Applications
              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Rockwool panels are ideal for safety-critical structures,
                providing fire-rated walls and roofs for high-occupancy and
                industrial facilities. They excel in noise management, forming
                effective acoustic enclosures for generators, turbines, and
                sensitive control rooms. Designed to maintain operational
                integrity, these panels insulate HVAC systems and machine rooms,
                minimizing both energy loss and noise. Their superior fire
                resistance and hygiene properties also make them suitable for
                specialized environments such as clean rooms, laboratories, and
                cold storage applications.
