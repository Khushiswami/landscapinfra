      question: "What Exactly is a Prefab Multi-Storey Building?",
      answer:
        "Its an engineering shift. Instead of constructing entirely on-site, a prefab multi-storey building uses precision-engineered components manufactured in a controlled factory environment. These large, high-quality sections are then rapidly and cleanly assembled vertically at your location.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "How Do Prefab Timelines Beat Traditional Construction? The secret is simultaneous workflow.",
      answer:
        "We eliminate long sequential waiting periods because the foundation work on your site happens concurrently while the structural components are being manufactured in our factory. This parallel process can cut the overall project schedule by up to 50%, enabling exceptionally fast completion.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Can We Still Achieve a Premium Architectural Look, Like Glass Facades?",
      answer:
        "Yes, customization is effortless. The core steel structure is fundamentally adaptable, acting as a flexible frame for any aesthetic. This allows for extensive design choices, including striking full glass facades, advanced architectural panels, or traditional premium veneers.",
    },
    {
      question: "How Fast is the On-Site Assembly?",
      answer:
        "Once the components arrive, the process is incredibly rapid. The main multi-storey steel framework can often be safely erected and ready for the next phase in just a few weeks.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the Long-Term Financial Advantages?",
      answer:
        "The benefits extend far beyond the initial build. The most significant advantage is accelerated occupancy, which ensures an earlier and higher Return on Investment (ROI). Furthermore, the use of durable, low-maintenance materials significantly reduces operating costs over the entire lifespan of the building.",
    },
    {
      question: "Where Do These Buildings best??",
      answer:
        "They are the ideal solution for any project where quality and speed are critical. This includes new corporate offices, hospitals, educational institutions, retail centers, and particularly the vertical expansion of existing industrial facilities.",
    },
    {
      question: "How Do We Guarantee Quality from a Distance?",
      answer:
        "At Landsking Infra, quality is guaranteed through stringent, factory-controlled QA protocols. Since approximately 90% of the build is off-site, every component is precision-engineered, measured, and inspected under controlled conditions, drastically minimizing human error before reaching your site.",
    },
    {
      question: "Who are the Recognized Leaders in Indian Prefabrication??",
      answer:
        "The industry is anchored by large-scale, quality-focused players. Key manufacturers like Tata BlueScope Steel, Everest Industries, EPACK Prefab, and Bajaj PEB are consistently cited as top performers known for capacity and compliance with international standards.",
