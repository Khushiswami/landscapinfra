      question: "What is a modern factory building?",
      answer:
        "It stands as a mission-critical asset, meticulously engineered to enclose specific production protocols while maximizing unobstructed internal volume, load capacity, and process flow efficiency.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What materials are used in advanced factory building construction?",
      answer:
        "The established norm is high-tensile structural steel (typically Pre-Engineered) for the framework, complemented by specialized metal roofing and high-performance insulated panel systems for the envelope.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What are the key benefits of choosing prefabricated factory buildings?",
      answer:
        "They deliver a significantly expedited market entry (boosting ROI) and ensure superior budget certainty, thanks to stringent, precise fabrication control over all modular elements.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "How does a pre-engineered factory building differ from a traditional building?",
      answer:
        "PEB facilities utilize an optimized, fully integrated construction methodology where components are manufactured off-site, thereby dramatically lowering on-site erection time and minimizing material wastage.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "How long does it typically take to construct a prefabricated factory building?",
      answer:
        "Owing to the strategy of concurrent engineering and manufacturing, the on-site construction duration is often 30–50% shorter than standard methods, rapidly achieving operational status.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are prefabricated factory buildings durable and long-lasting?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. They are structurally designed as permanent, high-value capital assets. The utilization of durable, quality-controlled steel guarantees a functional service life of five decades or more.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What is the strategic role of insulation in factory buildings?",
      answer:
        "Insulation is vital for sustaining exact internal climatic conditions, which sharply reduces energy expenditure for environmental control and fosters a more comfortable, productive space for equipment and staff.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What are the maintenance requirements for prefabricated factory buildings?",
      answer:
        "Maintenance is characteristically minimal and highly predictable, primarily involving routine inspections and cleaning, enabled by the use of corrosion-resistant coated steel and durable cladding materials.",
