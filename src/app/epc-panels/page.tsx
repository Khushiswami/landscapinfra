      question: "What are PUF/PIR Sandwich Panels?",
      answer:
        "PUF (Polyurethane Foam) and PIR (Polyisocyanurate) panels are high-performance insulated sandwich panels with a core of rigid foam between metal sheets. LandsKing Infra manufactures these panels to provide superior thermal insulation, strength, and energy efficiency for modern construction.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between PUF and PIR panels?",
      answer:
        "While both offer excellent insulation, PIR panels provide higher fire resistance and slightly better thermal efficiency than standard PUF panels, making them suitable for specialized applications.",
    },
    {
      question: "What types of PUF/PIR panels does LandsKing Infra offer?",
      answer:
        "We offer wall and roof panels with various surface finishes, ribbing options, and core densities to meet diverse industrial, commercial, and cold storage requirements.",
    },
    {
      question: "What thicknesses and widths are available in PUF/PIR panels?",
      answer:
        "Thicknesses range from 40 mm to 150 mm, while standard panel widths are designed for optimal coverage and minimal joints, ensuring fast installation and structural reliability.",
    },
    {
      question: "Where are PUF/PIR panels commonly used?",
      answer:
        "These panels are ideal for cold storage facilities, industrial warehouses, commercial buildings, clean rooms, and modular structures requiring thermal insulation and fire safety.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are PUF/PIR panels fire-resistant and weatherproof?",
      answer:
        "Yes. PUF panels are treated to meet fire safety standards, and both PUF and PIR panels are resistant to moisture, weathering, and pests, ensuring durability in varied conditions.",
    },
    {
      question: "How energy-efficient are PUF/PIR panels?",
      answer:
        "With high R-values and low thermal conductivity, these panels reduce energy consumption for heating and cooling, contributing to sustainable and cost-effective building operations.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can PUF/PIR panels be customized?",
      answer:
        "Yes. LandsKing Infra provides panels in customized thicknesses, finishes, profiles, and sizes to suit specific project requirements, ensuring flexibility in design and application.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can PUF/PIR panels be used for roofing and walls?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. They are suitable for both walls and roofing systems, offering lightweight, high-strength solutions for industrial, commercial, and cold storage applications.",
    },
    {
      question: "How are PUF/PIR panels installed?",
      answer:
        "Panels are designed for quick, secure installation using mechanical fasteners, adhesives, or overlap methods. LandsKing Infra also provides technical support and guidance to ensure proper installation on-site.",
