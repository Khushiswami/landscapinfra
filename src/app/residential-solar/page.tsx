              solar power and reliable battery backup. During the day, it powers
              your home directly from the sun and stores surplus energy in
              advanced lithium batteries for use at night or during power cuts.
              Even on cloudy days or during high energy demand, the system
              automatically draws power from the grid, ensuring a smooth and
              uninterrupted electricity supply. With a bi-directional meter,
              your power usage and savings are accurately tracked — so you only
