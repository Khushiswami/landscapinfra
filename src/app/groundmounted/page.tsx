  const faqs: FAQ[] = [
    {
      question: "What is a ground-mounted solar system?",
      answer:
        "A ground-mounted solar system is a solar power setup installed directly on the ground instead of rooftops. It uses strong mounting structures to hold solar panels at the ideal tilt and direction, ensuring maximum sunlight capture and higher power generation. These systems are ideal for industries, commercial sites, and utility-scale projects with open land availability.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "How long does LandsKing Infra take to install a ground-mounted solar system?",
      answer:
        "Depending on size and site, we complete projects within 3–6 months from concept to commissioning. Our turnkey EPC model ensures smooth execution — from civil works to grid synchronization.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What are the government incentives for ground-mounted solar in India?",
      answer:
        "LandsKing Infra helps clients leverage Accelerated Depreciation (40%), GST benefits, and net metering advantages. We also guide businesses in claiming Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) to maximize financial returns.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What is the difference between ground-mounted solar and rooftop solar?",
      answer:
        "The key difference lies in installation and scalability. Rooftop solar systems are mounted on building roofs, making them suitable for homes or small businesses with limited space. Ground-mounted solar systems, on the other hand, are installed on open land, allowing for optimal orientation, better cooling, easier maintenance, and higher power output — perfect for large-scale energy needs.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "How can LandsKing Infra’s ground-mounted solar systems reduce grid energy use?",
      answer:
        "By generating clean, on-site electricity, LandsKing Infra systems significantly cut grid dependency and energy costs. They ensure stable, renewable power for 25+ years — supporting both savings and sustainability.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Which businesses can benefit most from ground-mounted solar installations?",
      answer:
        "Manufacturing plants, warehouses, schools, hospitals, and commercial complexes with open land benefit the most. These setups help reduce long-term electricity costs and meet green energy goals efficiently.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "How can we increase solar energy generation with a ground-mounted solar system?",
      answer:
        "You can enhance output by using single or dual-axis tracking systems, optimal tilt angles, and high-efficiency panels. Proper site analysis and minimal shading are key to consistent, high-yield performance.",
