      question: "What is housing built with PUF panels?",
      answer:
        "It’s a clever modular system using dense Polyurethane Foam (PUF) composites for the envelope, guaranteeing superior insulation and extremely fast structural build-up.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do PUF panel homes save money?",
      answer:
        "Savings come from greatly reduced on-site labor, ultra-quick assembly schedules, and a permanent drop in utility bills due to premium thermal efficiency.",
    },
    {
      question: "How good is PUF insulation for energy?",
      answer:
        "The panels create a perfect thermal seal, severely cutting down the cooling/heating energy needed, positioning the home as an ultra-low consumption asset.",
    },
    {
      question: "How fast can a PUF home be built?",
      answer:
        "The timeline is measured in weeks, not months, because all parts are ready-made; this accelerated schedule means occupants settle in much sooner than traditionally possible.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are PUF panel homes durable?",
      answer:
        "Yes, built on a light-gauge steel base, they possess high structural resilience against weather and maintain integrity over a long, guaranteed multi-decade lifespan.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can the design of PUF homes be changed?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. The modular core permits total architectural freedom for layout and external finishes, easily achieving any desired traditional or contemporary look.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are PUF homes comfortable to live in?",
      answer:
        "The dense composite provides inherent acoustic stability, ensuring a consistently quiet, temperature-controlled environment, regardless of the outside noise or climate.",
