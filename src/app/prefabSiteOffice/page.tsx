        "It is a pre-engineered, modular command unit where components are factory-built, guaranteeing rapid asset deployment as a durable, operational headquarters for any remote project site.",
    },
    {
      question: "What materials are used to build prefab offices?",
      answer:
        "Construction utilizes light-gauge C-section steel framing coupled with high-density, Insulated Sandwich Panels (ISPs), forming a superior, integrated structural and thermal envelope.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the key benefits of using prefab site offices?",
      answer:
        "They deliver strategic advantages through accelerated operational readiness and predictable scheduling, maximizing resource utility while eliminating traditional site construction delays.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are prefab site offices energy efficient?",
      answer:
        "Yes. The high thermal resistance of the ISP envelope drastically minimizes thermal bridging and external heat load, resulting in substantial operational cost reductions for climate control.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can prefab site offices be relocated?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. Their modular architecture facilitates exceptional asset portability, allowing them to be efficiently disassembled and reassembled, thereby extending the utility and retaining investment value.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to install a prefab site office?",
      answer:
        "Final erection is highly accelerated, often achieving full occupancy status within days or two short weeks, a timeline that significantly compresses the typical critical path scheduling.",
    },
    {
      question: "Which industries commonly use prefab site offices?",
      answer:
        "They are indispensable for sectors requiring swift, robust administration, including large-scale infrastructure projects, remote mining operations, energy exploration, and capital construction programs.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can prefab site offices handle extreme weather conditions?",
      answer:
        "Yes, they are robustly engineered to meet site-specific climatic demands (wind, snow, heat), ensuring a structurally sound and comfortable environment under punishing external conditions.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are prefab site offices customizable?",
      answer:
        "Yes, the modular system allows complete control over layout partitioning, technology integration, and utility routing, ensuring the final build perfectly matches the operational mandate.",
    },
